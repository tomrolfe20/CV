## A B O U T M E

For the last 6 years I have worked as a General
Manager and Director in the events industry for
some of the largest music festivals in the world,
I realised a need for an efficient digital
recruitment platform in the industry. What
initially started as an idea with a friend has now
become a fully functioning app and web
platform, with over 4000 users. From concept
to production, the whole project really ignited
my interest in coding and the development
process, so I began my own journey into
learning to code. For 19 months, I've been
working through a multitude of online tutorials
and completing all of the relevant Front-End
Codecademy courses as well as most recently completing the Makers Academy bootcamp.
I have vast experience problem solving in high
pressure environments and I have learned to
excel in these situations. I am now ready for the
next step in my career as a Front-End Web
Developer. I am incredibly hard working and feel
I will make a solid addition to any development
or project team with an enthusiasm for
problem solving and learning from my peers.
